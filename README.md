In this repository, there are projects in [my DataCamp workspace](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/elifulkuk) I completed from DataCamp.
1. The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning - Use Natural Language Processing on NIPS papers to uncover the trendiest topics in machine learning research.
2. Find Movie Similarity from Plot Summaries - Use NLP and clustering on movie plot summaries from IMDB and Wikipedia to quantify movie similarity.
3. Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats - Analyze an A/B test from the popular mobile puzzle game, Cookie Cats. 
4. Native Bees: Deep Learning with Images - Build a deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images.
5. Give Life: Predict Blood Donations - Build a binary classifier to predict if a blood donor is likely to donate again.
6. Risk and Returns - Use pandas to calculate and compare profitability and risk of different investments using the Sharpe.
7. Classify Song Genres from Audio Data - Rock or rap? Apply machine learning methods in Python to classify songs into genres.
8. Predicting Credit Card Approvals - Build a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved.
9. Who's Tweeting? Trump or Trudeau? - Build a machine learning classifier that knows whether President Trump or Prime Minister Trudeau is tweeting!
